A Beascuit AutoRoller for the game Cookie Run Kingdom.

To edit the stat you want and the amount of each stat per line, change the variables in main. Amount for a line being 0 means you will not accept only that many lines.
This is roughly 100% accurate but it is possible that discrepancies will arise. Every roll is saved in a sqlite file, which you can delete the code for if needed.
